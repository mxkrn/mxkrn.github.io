description: Achord is a Max for Live application that detects chords in real-time, directly from an audio signal. Surprisingly, although the research is nearly 20 years old, this sort of application was not offered by anyone else within the Max for Live community. The chord detection API is primarily made possible by going beyond the built-in Max objects and instead using the Node for Max API to do the hard work.
